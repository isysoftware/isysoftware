### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Flavio Basile

Hi All and welcome to my  github space.
I'm an Analyst and  Software Developer. 
My code is written in Delphi : Delphi was my first programming language when I started to write code professionally! 
In the few past years, I found Python on my road. And I think that I was lucky for this.
