Hi All ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my  github space.
I'm an Analyst and  Software Developer. 
My code is written in Delphi : Delphi was my first programming language when I started to write code professionally! 
In the few past years, I found Python on my road. And I think that I was lucky for this.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on me: I'm studying, I'm reading, I'm viewing everything that can help me to know! I think that everyone couldn't never stop learning!
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Delphi, something about Python; ask me about computer programming.
